Motivation
Mayday was developed to tackle the problem of communication failures during natural disasters, network outages, or in remote areas. When regular internet-based apps fail, Mayday‚Äôs offline-first design ensures that users can send out SOS signals, access first aid information, and communicate without needing a network connection.

Features

Offline SOS Messaging: Send distress signals without internet or cellular connection.
Predefined Emergency Contacts: Instantly notify trusted contacts with location information and distress messages via SMS or over the mesh network.
GPS Location Sharing: Share your exact location with rescuers or friends even when offline.
üìç Location Tracking & Mapping
Offline Maps: Track your location and pinpoint others around you using GPS, without relying on internet maps.
Location-Based Alerts: Receive location-triggered alerts to ensure help is nearby.

üéôÔ∏è Voice Command Integration
Hands-free interactions with the app using voice commands. For instance, "Help with burns" will guide you through first aid steps.
üîó Mesh Network Communication
Establishes a local mesh network over WiFi to communicate directly with nearby devices, allowing text messages, voice, and video calls even without internet.
Unique Mesh Network Features
Mayday harnesses the power of mesh networks for seamless offline communication, setting it apart from other emergency apps.

üåê Mesh Networking for Communication
Decentralized Communication: Devices communicate without a central server, forming a resilient network. Mayday devices can act as nodes, passing messages between users over multiple hops to extend coverage.

Data Transmission Without Internet: Data such as SOS messages, location data, and voice/video calls are transmitted directly between devices using the mesh network, even in the most remote locations.

Fast and Reliable: The mesh network allows high-speed (300Mbps+) data transfer across large areas, such as remote towns, hiking trails, or disaster zones.

Architecture
The Mayday app is built using:

Frontend: Kotlin for Android and TypeScript for web services.
Backend: Built using decentralized communication protocols to support peer-to-peer mesh networking.
Encryption: End-to-end encryption using libsodium ensures that all communications remain private and secure.
