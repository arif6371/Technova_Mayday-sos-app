/**
 * The UdpForwardRule performs NAT-style port forwarding. It can forward traffic received on a
 * localSocket to a destination, and route return packets back.
 *
 * It receives packets on a local socket (UDP) socket. When a packet is received, it will:
 *
 *  a) Create a "return path" (if not already created) by opening another UDP socket on a random port
 *     on the same interface as the toAddress. This return path is linked to the address and port
 *     from which a packet was received (so it knows where to send any return packets received).
 *  b) Send the packet using the return path socket to the given toAddress/toPort
 *  c) When the return path receives a reply, it will be sent using the local socket back to the
 *     senders origin address and port.
 *
 *
 * @param boundSocket a Socket that is listening on a particular interface (e.g. local interface)
 *                    where any packets received should be forwarded to the given toAddress/toPort
 * @param ioExecutor ExecutorService that will be used to send/receive packets
 * @param destAddress the address that packets will be forwarded to
 * @param destPort the port that packets will be forwarded to
 * @param returnPathSocketFactory a factory that is used to generate the return path required for
 *                                step a) above.
